# WFAA-Consulting-Project
## Project Overview
This repository contains the code and analysis performed for a project sponsored by Deloitte as part of the Graduate Consulting Practicum at the Wisconsin School of Business. The project aimed to address the decline in donors for a client by focusing on critical issues such as aging and donor segmentation. The primary goal was to provide actionable insights and a clear framework to tackle these challenges effectively.

## Key Objectives
Data Cleaning and Preparation:

Utilized Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA) to guide the cleaning process of over 100,000 missing values.
Employed machine learning models, including CatBoost, neural networks, and random forests for predictive imputation, achieving a ROC AUC of 0.94 and an 82% accuracy.
Customer Segmentation:

Applied the RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) model to categorize donors into different value tiers.
Employed K-Means and DBSCAN clustering algorithms to identify over 7,000 high-potential donors within the Acquaintance group.
Outreach Strategy Development:

Compared high-potential donors with higher-level donors using Random Forest, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting models.
Applied Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to identify 10 key demographic features that represent 90% of the variance influencing donor conversion.
Achieved a 48% upgrade in donor tiers and secured an 80% retention rate through targeted outreach strategies.
## Results
Data Imputation: Successfully cleaned the dataset by filling in missing values using advanced machine learning techniques, resulting in a highly accurate and reliable dataset for further analysis.
Donor Segmentation: Identified high-potential donors using both K-Means and DBSCAN clustering methods, with a preference for K-Means due to its consistency and interpretability.
Targeted Outreach: Developed effective outreach strategies that significantly improved donor tier upgrades and retention rates, demonstrating the practical impact of the analysis.
## Conclusion
The analysis provided a robust framework for understanding and addressing donor decline, with a strong focus on actionable insights and strategic recommendations. The combination of advanced data cleaning, precise segmentation, and targeted outreach strategies proved to be highly effective in achieving the project's goals.
